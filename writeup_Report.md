**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report


[//]: # (Image References)

[image1]: ./test_images_output/solidWhiteRight_output.jpg "lane lines drawn on an image"

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

 pipeline workflow :
image read -> gray scale -> gaussian blur -> canny edge detection -> region of interest ->
hough lines detection -> draw lines on black -> add it onto the images

This workflow is reflecting the pipeline for a single image but it is the same for a video stream as well.

### Modifications on "draw_lines" function:
Calculated the slope for each line in lines that is generated by hough transform.
Filtered the lines if the absolute slope value is less than 0.5 (filtering out extreme lines)
separated the left and right lines depending on the slope. If it is negative slope, that means it is a left lane (image origin 0,0 is top left) and if the slope is positive that means it is a right lane.
Added x1,x2,y1,y2 and the y intercept points to relevant lists. 
Fixed y_min and y_max values referenced to image sizes.
After getting all the lines, calculated the average of all slopes for both Right and Left lane lines.
By using that, I put the values in to the y = mx + c equation to get x_min and x_max. 
Used x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max to draw stable lines.


### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when we have missing lane lines on on side.
Also, another shortcoming could happen when using a different camera lens, which will have different lens distortion may end up with observing lane lines above 0.5 slope. 


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to average sequential images in order to reduce the flicker on the drawn lines.
